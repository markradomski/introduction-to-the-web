  <h1>How to set up an HTML document.</h1>

  <!-- Skip to line 34 to see readable markup -->

  <h2 style="color: red;">TOO LONG; DIDN'T READ:</h2>
  <p>To start building an HTML page you need at least the following markup in your .html file:</p>
  <blockquote><code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
    &lt;html&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Your Markup&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
    &lt;/html&gt;
  </code></blockquote>

  <h2>The DOCTYPE</h2>
  <p>The DOCTYPE, found at <code>line 1</code> of this document, basically signals the browser that this document is indeed an HTML document.</p>
  <p>This is necessary because there are a couple languages that look a lot like HTML, and we want to make sure the browser interprets it as HTML rather than something else.</p>

  <h2>The &lt;html&gt; element</h2>
  <p>The &lt;html&gt; element represents the <strong>root</strong> of an HTML document, that's why it's also referred to as the <i>root element</i>. All other elements must be descendants of &lt;html&gt;, no matter what.</p>
  <p>That said, there are only 2 elements that are allowed as <strong>direct</strong> descendants: The &lt;head&gt; and the &lt;body&gt;</p>

  <h2>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></h2>
  <p>The &lt;head&gt; is the part of an HTML document that contains metadata about that document, such as author, description, and links to CSS or JavaScript files that should be applied to the HTML.</p>
  <p>Think of it as the first couple pages of a book. It names the author, year of release, the publisher, a summary etc.</p>

  <h3>Meta tags</h3>
  <p>We established that meta tags exist to give the browser information about the document. However, they are not always directly relevant to the <strong>contents</strong> of the page.</p>
  <p>For example: <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> signals the browser on what character encoding to use. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UTF-8" target="_blank">UTF-8</a> is the standard for the web, and you will use this character set 99.9999% of the times.</p>

  <p>Try to replace <code>"iso-8859-1" (line 4)</code> with <code>utf-8</code>, and see the difference with the following sentence:</p>
  <blockquote>Можешь прочитать это?</blockquote>
  <p>You do not have to know how character encodings work, as long as you keep in mind that it should be utf-8.</p>
  <small>Sidenote: <code>iso-8859-1</code> is the character encoding for "Westen Alphabet", which is also the reason why Russian does not work</small>

  <h2>The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code></h2>
  <p>The &lt;body&gt; represents the content of an HTML document. We learned that <strong>the &lt;head&gt; communicates to the browser</strong>. <strong>The &lt;body&gt; communicates towards your audience; the users</strong>.</p>
  <p>This means all text, images, and other data you want to display should always be in the body.</p>
