        <h1>Going underground: Slide into an old German salt mine, 130 metres below sea level</h1>

      <h2>Descend into the darkness at Berchtesgaden and sail across a lake hidden deep below the ground</h2>

      <p>Perched at the top of one of the steep wooden slides that drop between levels in the Berchtesgaden Salt Mine, deep beneath
      the Austria-German border, I peer down into blackness. Without either a harness, seatbelt or railings, there’s no discernible
      way of preventing myself from catapulting into the wall at the other end if I reach critical momentum. I cling like a baby
      spider monkey to the shoulders of the man sitting in front of me, an Australian tourist I met a couple of minutes ago.</p>

      <p>We push off from the edge; my stomach bounds; and within seconds we slide to a graceful halt in the middle of the rest of
      our tour group. A barely audible swish, and our guide, Joseph, lands next to me, with a casual indifference that makes me
      wonder if he goes down head-first when tourists aren’t around.</p>

      <p>The 500-year-old salt mine is cool, dark and dirty – a world away from Salzburg’s Mozart-branded chocolates and double-decker
      trawling the Sound of Music trail. Some 330,000 people visit the city each year, and tours of the mine have proved popular
      with those keen to escape the city’s usual haunts – to such an extent that the route is now expanding. One cavern in development
      when I went earlier this year promised to become an interactive salt gallery, which is now open.</p>
