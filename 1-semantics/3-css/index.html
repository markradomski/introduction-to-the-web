    <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
    <p>Holy shit, we are not looking at that eye-straining browser default design anymore, you could almost say it looks
      <i>nice</i>. We altered the look & feel of our document by using CSS!</p>
    <p><q>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
    in a markup language.</q> (from Wikipedia).<br>
    Let's translate this to human - CSS is a language used to visually enhance the presentation of your HTML document.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>CSS is very simple! and it is loads of fun to play around with it.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Create a new folder on a location you will remember, perhaps (dare I say it) Desktop?, folder-name does not matter!
          <small>If you really can't decide on a folder-name, then lets call it xx-my_awesome_project-xx</small></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Copy <a href="../2-elements/" target="_blank">semantics.html</a> from the previous chapter and paste the file into your newly-made folder!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Create a new file in your directory, call it <code>my-style.css</code>. Your folder-structure should now look like the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code>
            <strong>YourNewlyCreatedFolder</strong><br>
            &nbsp;|-semantics.html<br>
            &nbsp;|-my-style.css
          </code>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Within <code>my-style.css</code> type the following: <code>body { background-color: red; }</code>. We have written our first styles!</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Refresh your HTML file, you will notice the background is... not red</p></li>
      <li><p>We still need to "link" the file! Luckily the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> can request this for us! In order to request the file, put the following in your document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>: <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="my-style.css"&gt;</code></p></li>
    </ol>
