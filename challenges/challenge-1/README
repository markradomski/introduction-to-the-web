### Challenge 1

A big part of "being a programmer" is knowing how to google.
So I am going to throw you guys into the deep, and you can google your way out.

Create a rough HTML/CSS version of the image located in assets/, called design.png

Feel free to google, copy and paste whatever you like,
as long as your final product looks somewhat similar to the image in the assets folder.

Don't worry about typography, feel free to use Times new Roman and Arial.
Don't worry about images, feel free to use random background-colours.
This is all about LAYOUT. ٩(◕‿◕)۶


I have created an HTML file and linked a CSS file to it for you to work from, gl.

keywords for google: flexbox, css-grid, flexbox center box

LEGENDARY MODE:

Do all layout-related styles using CSS-GRID (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).
